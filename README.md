# Note: I'm starting a public-friendly version of this project [here](https://github.com/arecker/bennedetto)

Hi guys,

I threw this django application together for a personal experiment.  Because there was a lot of interest in the idea, I've decided to reboot the project.

I am hoping to push the initial revision of "bennedetto" soon.  I'm aiming for

- Better documentation and build instructions
- Better test suite
- Public registration

Stay tuned, and thanks for the interest.  I am looking forward to building something really cool with all of you.

Thanks,

Alex
